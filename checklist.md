- [x] Populate README detailing the FinOps & Capacity Planning objective.

## 3. Historical Data & Features üìä
- [x] Define data source (e.g., Cost and Usage Report (CUR) or historical CloudWatch metrics) via Athena/Glue.
- [x] Define target variable (e.g., daily cost, hourly GPU utilization) for prediction.
- [x] Implement feature engineering for time-series data (e.g., day of week, month, holidays).
- [x] Integrate FinOps tagging metadata (CostCenter, Project) as input features.
- [x] Define data validation checks (e.g., no negative cost values, missing timestamps).

## 4. Regression Model Development & Training üìâ
- [x] Implement src/train/forecaster_train.py for training the regression model.
- [x] Define Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) strategy for minimizing error.
- [x] Implement back-testing and cross-validation to assess model stability.
- [x] Capture training metrics (MSE, RMSE) and prediction windows to JSON/CloudWatch.
- [x] Notebook placeholders: 01-Data-Exploration, 02-Model-Benchmarking.

## 5. Testing & Quality Gates ‚úÖ
- [x] Unit tests for feature engineering/time-series data prep.
- [x] Unit tests for RMSE calculation against baseline forecasts.
- [x] Integration test stub for the full data retrieval ‚Üí forecast ‚Üí recommendations flow.
- [x] Configure pytest + coverage thresholds.
- [x] Define quality gate: Forecast RMSE ‚â§ Baseline (e.g., 5%) for CI pass.
- [x] Comprehensive validation framework with ModelValidator class.
- [x] Backtesting and cross-validation test implementation.
- [x] Quality gate threshold validation with MAPE/RMSE metrics.
- [x] Data collector unit tests (13/13 passing).

- [x] Exception handling and error validation tests.
- [x] Test coverage reporting and quality assurance setup.

## 6. Real-Time Forecasting Service üí≤
- [x] Define inference service API contract for budget prediction.
- [x] Implement src/inference/forecaster_handler.py (data prep, model loading, prediction logic).
- [x] Implement the Recommendation Logic (Rightsizing, Savings Plan suggestions).
- [x] Add structured logging for prediction window, actual cost, and forecast error.
- [x] Package inference code for containerization (e.g., Fargate/Lambda).

## 7. Infrastructure (CDK) üèóÔ∏è
- [x] Flesh out infra/forecaster_stack.py (VPC resources, IAM roles).
- [x] Define deployment using private subnets and VPC Endpoints only.
- [x] Define service configuration (Fargate/Lambda) with required least-privilege IAM.
- [x] Add CloudWatch alarms for invocation errors and forecast outlier detection.

## 8. FinOps Workflow Orchestration ‚è±Ô∏è
- [x] Document the Step Functions daily forecast ‚Üí evaluate ‚Üí alert flow.
- [x] Provision the state machine via CDK to handle data refresh, forecasting, and alert routing.
- [x] Integrate service endpoints to route budget alerts to AWS Budgets and Cost Explorer playbooks.
- [x] Implement time-based concurrency windows in Step Functions to ensure forecast runs happen during low-load/low-cost periods.
- [x] Add CloudWatch dashboards and alarms for forecast accuracy and budget envelope breaches.
- [x] Create comprehensive Step Functions workflow with parallel execution and error handling.

- [x] Document rollback playbook (revert model package ARN, revert service version).
- [ ] Provide teardown automation (Makefile/Nox session).
- [ ] Capture CloudWatch dashboards screenshots for demo (RMSE trending, cost-per-environment).

## 10. CI/CD üîÑ
- [x] Create .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml (lint + tests + cdk synth).
