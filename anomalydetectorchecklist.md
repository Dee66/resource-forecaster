	- [ ] Ensure bucket names and retention windows are parameterizable via the global config loader.

4. NER Model Development & Training üè∑Ô∏è
- [ ] Implement src/train/ner_train.py for fine-tuning a small language model for entity extraction.

- [ ] Unit tests for entity extraction accuracy and labeling consistency.

	- [ ] Add CDK template unit tests (using aws_cdk.assertions.Template) to validate generated resources and Conditions without deploying.
	- [ ] Ensure CLI and deploy scripts run in-process during tests (so monkeypatching/stubbing works) rather than via subprocess when possible.
	- [ ] Add tests for dry-run behavior (no AWS calls by default) and an `apply` test mode that uses Stubber to simulate AWS responses.

6. Real-Time Enrichment Handler üö®
- [ ] Define inference service API contract for log enrichment.

- [ ] Implement src/inference/enrichment_handler.py (log parsing, NER tagging, anomaly scoring).

- [ ] Ensure KMS encryption and secure loading for all model artifacts.

- [ ] Add structured logging for audit trail traceability.

- [ ] Package inference code for secure containerization (e.g., Fargate/Lambda inside a private VPC).

- Operational additions:
	- [ ] Add audit persistence for actionable recommendations (DynamoDB audit table) and a nightly reconciler Lambda that checks whether recommended actions were implemented.
	- [ ] Emit CloudWatch custom metrics (e.g., `AnomalyRate`, `ReconciliationMissingCount`) and create alarms that can trigger retrain/workflow Lambdas.

7. Infrastructure (CDK) üèóÔ∏è
- [ ] Flesh out infra/security_detector_stack.py (VPC resources, IAM roles, KMS keys).

- [ ] Define deployment using private subnets and VPC Endpoints only.

- [ ] Define service configuration (Fargate/Lambda) with required least-privilege IAM.

- [ ] Tag every resource (App, Env, CostCenter) for audit and FinOps.

- CDK notes & best-practices from Resource Forecaster:
	- [ ] Parameterize infra via the central config (allow passing `model_bucket_name`, `data_bucket_name`, and `vpc_id` into the stack constructor).
	- [ ] For optional/inert resources (e.g., SageMaker endpoints for model serving), add a CloudFormation `CfnParameter` + `CfnCondition` so those resources are synth-only unless explicitly enabled.
	- [ ] When using L1 (Cfn*) constructs, prefer the typed property classes (e.g., `ProductionVariantProperty`, `ServerlessConfigProperty`) instead of raw dicts to avoid JSII deserialization errors.
	- [ ] Provide CDK unit tests that assert Conditions are set (resources exist but are gated by the `EnableX` parameter).

9. Deployment & Operations üîÅ

- [ ] Document rollback playbook (revert model package ARN, revert endpoint).

- [ ] Provide teardown automation (Makefile/Nox session).

- [ ] Capture CloudWatch dashboards screenshots for demo (showing event flow).

- Operational guardrails:
	- [ ] Deployment scripts must be dry-run by default and require explicit `--apply` or `ALLOW_AWS_DEPLOY=1` to perform AWS operations.
	- [ ] Include a budget/PaS guardrail script that evaluates predicted cost/fidelity and blocks deploys if thresholds are exceeded.
	- [ ] Provide unit tests for packaging/deploy scripts (run in-process and use stubbed clients).

10. CI/CD üîÑ
- [ ] Create .github/workflows/ci.yml (lint + tests + cdk synth).

- [ ] Add a security artifact validation stage in CI (e.g., check entity list for accidental PII inclusion).

- [ ] Add .github/workflows/deploy.yml with manual approval and environment protection.

- CI best-practices:
	- [ ] Run `poetry install` and use the project's local `.venv` in CI.

	- [ ] Add a synth step that runs `cdk synth --all --no-staging` and runs Template assertions to validate parameter presence and Conditions.

## Supplement ‚Äî Lessons & recommendations from implementing resource-forecaster

The Resource Forecaster project produced a number of practical learnings that are directly applicable when building the `anomaly-detector` plugin. Below is a compact, prioritized set of recommendations, anti-patterns to avoid, and starter tasks you can pick up immediately.

Key lessons (high level)
- Use feature-flagged infra for optional, costly resources. Gate heavy resources (SageMaker endpoints, training jobs) behind CloudFormation parameters + Conditions so synth is safe and deploys are explicit.
- Prefer small, focused unit tests and CDK template assertions over integration runs in CI. Stub AWS calls (botocore Stubber) and test behavior in-process.
- Enforce dry-run by default across packaging and deploy scripts. Make any destructive action require an explicit `--apply` or environment flag (`ALLOW_AWS_DEPLOY=1`).
- Centralize configuration (one loader) and keep per-environment YAMLs under `config/` to avoid duplication and accidental prod changes.
- Tag everything consistently using a small set of canonical tag keys (Application, Environment, CostCenter). Treat tags as policy primitives (used by Secrets Manager queries, IAM conditions, and billing reports).

Concrete infra & repo patterns
- CDK stack constructor should accept explicit resource names or prefixes (e.g., `model_bucket_name`, `alerts_topic_name`) rather than composing them ad-hoc inside the stack. This makes testing and local synth deterministic.
- When creating SNS topics/alarms/dashboards, put human-readable DisplayName separate from the resource logical name. Tests can assert both.
- Use typed CDK constructs where available (avoid passing raw dicts to L1 constructs unless necessary). This reduces JSII serialization errors.
- Add a lightweight `cdk-unit-tests/` pattern: small pytest files that create a Stack in several input permutations and assert Template conditions.

Testing & quality gates (recommended)
- Unit tests: data processing and anomaly scoring (happy path + edge cases). For example: empty inputs, constant series, single outlier, multi-outliers, time-windowed scoring.
- CDK tests: Template assertions for required resources (buckets, IAM roles, KMS keys) and for gating parameters.
- Integration-test stage (optional, gated): runs in a protected CI environment using curated test accounts and real resources; isolate costs and run cleanup.
- CI: fail fast on collection or template assertion failures. Run `poetry install` inside the subproject and `pytest --maxfail=1 -q`.

Operational and observability recommendations
- Emit custom metrics for anomaly-rate and reconciliation-missing-count. Build alarms that auto-mute during deploy windows to avoid noise.
- Persist audit entries for decisions into DynamoDB with a reconciliation job that compares recommended vs. applied actions. Emit a metric for missing reconciliations.
- Provide dashboards and a script to snapshot dashboards (for demos) and store them under `dashboards/`.

Starter tasks for the anomaly-detector plugin (concrete, high-value)
1. Add `config/{dev,prod}.yml` and a `src/detector/config.py` loader that prefers env vars then file.
2. Create `infra/security_detector_stack.py` with inputs: `enable_training`, `model_bucket_name`, `alerts_topic_name`, `kms_key_arn` and template unit-tests (aws_cdk.assertions.Template-based).
3. Implement `src/detector/scoring.py` with a test suite covering modified z-score, windowed scoring, and a simple reconciliation stub.
4. Add `scripts/package_model_artifacts.py` with a dry-run flag and deterministic S3 layout `model-packages/{env}/...`.
5. Add CI job `anomaly-detector/ci.yml` to run lint, pytest and `cdk synth` for the plugin in isolation.

Quick commands (dev flow)
```bash
# inside repository root
cd anomaly-detector
poetry install
poetry run pytest -q
cd ../infra
# synth plugin stack (example)
cdk synth -a "python infra/app.py" --profile dev
```

Anti-patterns observed
- Making infra resource names purely derived from display strings. Keep a separation so tests and ARNs remain stable.
- Running integration-style CDK tests in the default CI without cost controls ‚Äî this caused noise and failures during earlier runs.

Where this helps the next plugin
- The checklist items above already mirror many Resource Forecaster lessons; the supplement turns those practical tips into explicit starter tasks and patterns so you can iterate quickly when implementing the plugin.

If you want, I can now:
- Apply the top 5 starter tasks (create `config/` files, a minimal `infra/security_detector_stack.py` skeleton and template tests, and add CI workflow) as a follow-up.
- Produce example CDK template assertions for the SNS/KMS/bucket resources that the tests expect.
